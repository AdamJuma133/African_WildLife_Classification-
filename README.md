[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AdamJuma133/African_WildLife_Classification-/blob/main/cnn.ipynb)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify African wildlife species. The notebook is designed to run seamlessly in Google Colab.

## Features
- Pretrained models for wildlife classification.
- Easy-to-use interface for testing new images.
- Automatic access to datasets via Colab integrations.

## Getting Started
1. Click the **"Open In Colab"** button above.
2. Run the cells in the notebook step-by-step.
3. Upload your wildlife images for classification.

## Requirements
- A Google account to access Colab.
- Internet connection to load datasets and models.

## How It Works
1. The notebook initializes by downloading required datasets.
2. The CNN model is trained or loaded with pretrained weights.
3. The user can test the model by uploading images.
